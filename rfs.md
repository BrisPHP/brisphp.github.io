title: Request for speakers
---

BrisPHP enthusiastically welcomes talk proposals from the community. We track talks with 
[GitHub issues](https://github.com/brisphp/meetups/issues) where you can create an issue to propose your talk and we liase
with you on dates and sharing your resources afterwards (where possible).

## About the Meetup

BrisPHP meets quarterly, striving for a big night with a brief “What’s new in PHP Land” by Nathan as well as 2 - 3 talks
 from the community (typically 10-20 minutes long). The decision to meet quarterly allows us to channel energy into 
 securing multiple high-quality talks rather than a single monthly talk for the sake of meeting monthly. Additionally,
 we find that much of the community goes to greater lengths to be able to attend the Meetup as it isn't particularly 
 frequent. 

## Scope for talks

The only scope for talks is that they must be genuinely interesting to the audience. There is no 
 restriction that it must be strictly PHP related, code examples in PHP or even be a technical talk but obviously use 
 your judgement on how best to communicate your message.
 
## About the audience
 
We survey the community once a year, which lets us get basic demographics that are relevant to future speakers, as well
as identifying desired talk themes and areas for improvement.

### The audience skews more senior than many other local Meetups

* Approximately 60% have been working with PHP for greater than 10 years
* Nearly 25% greater than 15 years.

### Developers & leaders

Majority are technical, but many team leads/managers commensurate with the more senior demographic. 

* 43% as "Fullstack developers"
* 24% as "Backend developers"
* 24% as "Manager or leader".

### Gamut of "stacks" in use

Asked what stacks they predominately work in (allows multiple responses):

* 47% - Laravel
* 33% - No framework
* 19% - Symfony
* 14% - Homegrown framework
* 14% - Wordpress

### Ready to learn just about everything

Asked a selection of topics they are interested in, "general code structure & architecture" and
 "lessons learned" ranked the highest at 90% and 81% of attendees. Even the lowest ranked topics, "Non technical skills"
  and "soft skills" still had 42% of attendees interested.

Other topics of interest:
* Deployment
* Testing & static analysis
* Algorithms
* Frontend
* Intro to frameworks/libraries

### Engaged community ready to learn

Asked what they want out of BrisPHP:

* 95% want to learn something new
* 85% want to meet other people
* 71% want to share what they've learned

Asked whether they're recommend BrisPHP to friends & colleagues (aka the NPS question), they responded with a 
NPS score of 86. Anecdotally, there is a comparatively very high return return rate.

## Next steps

We hope this provides you with enough context to work out what you want to talk about at BrisPHP. The next step is
to create an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/brisphp/meetups/issues) for your awesome talk!
